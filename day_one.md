## Cloud Computing 
- Cloud computing is the delivery of I.T services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet where users 
can rent or lease these resources from cloud service providers such as AWS,Azure,GCP etc.

## Benefits of AWS
- Scalable-organizations can scale up or down based on demand or workload and accomodate any workload.
- Flexibilty and a variety of services-AWS has many services like computing power, storage, databases which allows users to choose specific services that meet their specifications or requirements.
- Global reach- through use of availability zones located in various regions,AWS global infrastructure enables users to deploy applications and services close to their end-users, reducing latency and improving performance
- Security-AWS has various security features like identity and access management, encryption, monitoring etc that enables user to build robust and secure applications
- Reliability and High Availability-multiple AZ(Availability Zones) within regions ensures applications remain available even in the instance of hardware failures or any other issue
- Cost-Efficiency: AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where users pay only for the resources they consume and thus there is no need for upfront capital expenditure.
- Elasticity and Auto-Scaling: AWS allows users to automatically scale resources based on demand. Auto-scaling features enable the adjustment of computing capacity to maintain performance during peak times while minimizing costs during periods of lower demand.
- Global Content Delivery: AWS offers content delivery services like Amazon CloudFront, enabling the delivery of content, including videos and web pages, with low latency and high transfer speeds to users around the world


## Differences between on-demand delivery and cloud deployments
- On-demand delivery and cloud deployments are related concepts but refer to different aspects of cloud computing

## On-Demand Delivery
- The ability to access and consume computing resources or services as needed, without the need for long-term commitments or upfront investments.

## Cloud deployment
 Cloud deployment refers to the hosting and running of applications, services, or infrastructure on cloud computing platforms rather than on traditional on-premises servers or data centers

 ## Service models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Deploying virtual machines, storage, and networking components in the cloud.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Developing and deploying applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Accessing software applications over the internet on a subscription basis


## Pay as you go model
- In this model, customers are billed based on their actual usage of resources or services, rather than making upfront payments or committing to a fixed subscription fees 

## Deployment models
- Public Cloud: Easily accessible to the general public.
- Private Cloud (On-Premises): Accessible within an organisation.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private cloud.
- Community Cloud: It shares the infrastructure between several organisations from a specific community.

## On premises vs cloud
- To differentiate between running workloads on-premises and in the cloud, consider a scenario in which developers must deploy a new application feature. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the same configurations as production. In an on-premises solution, an additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. 

In contrast, by running your application in the cloud, you can replicate an entire production environment in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, the solution is managed over the internet.
